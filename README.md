## Preface

Recommended Reads is a user-driven website that allows people to recommend books to other readers. A user can browse through books by genre and see the rating as well as other usersâ€™ reviews of the book. They will also be able to rate and leave a review of a book they have already read to let other people know their opinion. Subsequently, a user can add a book that currently does not exist and allow others to rate and review it. This website aims to create an easy-to-use space for book lovers to exchange their appraisals or criticisms of books they read.

In total, there were dozens of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, 4 tables in the database, and 10 Java Servlets.
